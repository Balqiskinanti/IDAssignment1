This is my first ever website I made for my Interactive Development module. I chose to do portfolio as it's a good 
starting point and I can put my personality to it :clinking_glasses:. This website is a showcase of some of my works
and my skills.

### Design Process
I designed this website for potential recruiters that might consider hiring me. My goal is to present myself 
in the best light by showcasing my past projects, skills, experinces and achievements. With this, potential
recruiters will be able to see the style of graphics and web design I do.

Some bugs and problems that I encounter are the paddings in the mobile view. The contents in between the header and
footer gets pushed to the left when screen size gets smaller.
