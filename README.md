This is my first ever website I made for my Interactive Development module. I chose to do portfolio as it's a good 
starting point and I can put my personality to it :clinking_glasses:. This website is a showcase of some of my works
and my skills.

### Design Process
I designed this website for potential recruiters that might consider hiring me. My goal is to present myself 
in the best light by showcasing my past projects, skills, experinces and achievements. With this, potential
recruiters will be able to see the style of graphics and web design I do. 

As a recruiter of a web designer, i woud like to see the previous projects that the applicants have done. 
Apart from that, i would prefer to have a list of achievements and skills to refer to so that i know
if the applicant is suitable for the job. another useful information include brief description of the applicant. 

The most important thing of all, is to have the contact page easily navigated. This is so that the recruiter 
can easily contact the applicant. Which is why, i put my contacts on a whole other page and also include it
on my main page with additional features which is the form so that they can easily reach out to me. The user can 
also just click on the my email/ phone number and it will bring them to mail/ call feature in their laptop/ phone.

Personally, i prefer websites that have fixed header so that i can easily get to the menu. To get to the main 
page user can easily click on the logo , which is pretty intuitive.

I also made links hoverable so that the user knows that it will bring them to a new page.

:pushpin: How my project looks :
![web image desktop](https://github.com/Balqiskinanti/ID_S10204973G_BalqisKinantiHaldiHeryputri_Assg1_website/blob/main/pictures/landing-page.PNG)

Some bugs and problems that I encounter are the paddings in the mobile view. The contents in between the header and
footer gets pushed to the left when screen size gets smaller.
