This is my first ever website I made for my Interactive Development module. I chose to do portfolio as it's a good 
starting point and I can put my personality to it :clinking_glasses:. This website is a showcase of my works
and my skills with the **goal of promoting myself** as a front-end web developer. 

I designed this website for **potential recruiters** that might consider hiring me. My goal is to present myself 
in the best light by showcasing my past projects, skills, experinces and achievements. With this, potential
recruiters will be able to understand what I have to offer.

### Design Process
*UX* 

As a recruiter of a front-end developer, i woud like to see the previous projects that the applicants have done. 
Apart from that, i would prefer to have his/her **work experience** and **list of achievements and skills** to refer to so that i know
if the applicant is suitable for the job. Another useful information include a brief description of the applicant. 

The most important thing of all, is to have the **contact page easily navigated**. This is so that the recruiter 
can easily contact the applicant. Which is why, i put my contacts on a whole other page and also include a contact
form so that they can easily reach out to me. The user can also just click on the my email/ phone number and it will 
bring them to mail/ call feature in their laptop/ phone. 

Personally, I much prefer websites that have **fixed menu** so that i can easily go to different pages. To get to the main 
page user can easily click on the logo , which is pretty intuitive.

I also added **hover effects** for any links so that the user knows that it will bring them to a new page. 

**Simplicity** is also important so that potential recruiters don't miss out on any important information.Focusing on
showcasing my projects is the best way to promote myself as a being a front-end developer requires doing multiple
projects. 

*UI*

As a recruiter of a front-end developer, i would also judge applicant's portfolio website based on its **aesthetics** since I also
promote myself as a graphic designer-meaning I'm expected to be able to design part/all interfaces of website. 

* I decided to go with **color scheme** of pink and off-white with occassional introduction of new colors like blue and yellow to
break the mundanity. 
* I choose **fonts** that looks professional and use it throughout my website. 
* The **layout** of all the pages are relatively similar but each of them has something different e.g. fixed title for projects page 
  but not for others.
* I include multiple stackings of words on top of picture to give my website a little bit more **personality and uniqueness**.

:pushpin: How my project looks :

In general my website function and looks the same throughout the different screen sizes. There's only 2 differences: 
* 1st difference: contact form's content goes down as screen size decrease.
